  The Slidorion
----------------------------------------------------------------

A combination of an image slider and an accordion, the slidorion displays beautiful images along with a variable length description. With images linked to each tab, and accompanied by a large array of effects, the slidorion is a great alternative to the traditional jQuery slider.
